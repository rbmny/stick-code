# Privacy Policy for Stick Code

**Last Updated:** August 11, 2025

## Overview

Stick Code is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal data. This privacy policy explains how the app handles your information.

## Data We Don't Collect

Stick Code does **NOT** collect any of the following:
- Personal information (name, email, phone number)
- Usage analytics or app usage data
- Crash reports or diagnostic data
- Location information
- Device identifiers
- Network activity or browsing data
- Any other personal or sensitive information

## What Stays on Your Device

The only data the app uses is stored locally on your device and never leaves your device:

- **SSH Connection Details**: Server hostnames, usernames, and port numbers you configure
- **Authentication Credentials**: Stored securely in your device's keychain using iOS security features
- **App Preferences**: Your personal settings and preferences for the app interface

This information is:
- Stored only on your device
- Protected by iOS security features
- Never transmitted to any server
- Only accessible by the Stick Code app
- Deleted when you delete the app

## Third-Party Services

Stick Code does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app connects directly to your SSH servers without routing through any external services.

## Children's Privacy

Since we don't collect any data, Stick Code is safe for users of all ages, including children under 13.

## Data Security

While we don't collect data, we take the security of your local information seriously:
- SSH credentials are stored in iOS keychain with encryption
- All connections use standard SSH security protocols
- No data is transmitted except directly to your SSH servers

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our approach to data collection (which we don't plan to do), we will update this privacy policy and notify users through an app update.
